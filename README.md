## Description

This repository contains the frontend for visualizing the analysis of raw data in the .abf format, focusing on studying translocating events through nanopores. The frontend provides an interactive dashboard to explore the results of signal analysis, clustering, and similar signal retrieval.

## Installation

### Requirements

Ensure Python (version 3.8 or newer) is installed on your system. The frontend serves static files using Python's built-in HTTP server.
